Welcome to the snake game. 

Collect food and points by moving the snake using the up, down, left, and right arrow keys.
When one piece of food is collected, your score will increase and another piece of food will appear.
The game ends when you run into yourself or the wall.

Run the main.py file to start and have fun!
